Points to remember:
P1. Hash Map is an unorder map, though Linkedhash map is ordered.
P2. Functional interface can only define one abstract function in it.
P3. Derived class can access the function of super though vice versa is not possible. If type of a list is defined as super than it will take only super type list as a param, not derived type.
